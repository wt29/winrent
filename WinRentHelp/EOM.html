<h1>End of Month Processing</h1>
<p>Winrent maintains Arrears and
Transaction records for all contracts in the system. These records are
simply historical records and are not needed to maintain balances etc
in the system. Althogh the routine is called "Monthly" there is no
actual requirement to perform this processs</p>
<p>The "Monthly" routine will
allow you to remove old Arrears and Transaction records from the
contracts. You could
choose (for example) to remove all records older that 3 years. This
would be done on a "ad-hoc" basis.</p>
<p>Note that once the
records are processed they cannot be retreived except by restoration
from a backup file. Therefore, we recommend that you perform a backup
before executing this routine.</p>
Winrent will prompt with last dates for both record types. Enter the
dates and Winrent will ask request confirmation before
proceeding.&nbsp;<br>
