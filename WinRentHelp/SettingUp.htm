<h1>Installing</h1>
<p>Winrent is shipped as a single stand alone executable. Installing the program simply requires copying the executable file "Winrent.exe" to a new folder and running it. </p>

<p>On a new installation of Winrent, the program will prompt to create the database tables that store Winrent information. Answer "Y" to the prompt. The files are created. You will then need to restart the program. Once the data files are created and after a restart of the program, Winrent will then create its index files. This should happen once only and will (with a new installation) be very quick - a matter of seconds.</p>

You are now presented with the Winrent Welcome screen and are ready to start using Winrent.
