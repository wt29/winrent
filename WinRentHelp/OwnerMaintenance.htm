<h1>Owner Maintenance</h1>
<p> All fleet items (items) must have an "owner". The owner may be your own company or often a leasing company. The main use of the owner file to sort and print the "Bailment Listing". A bailment listing is used to inform leasing owners of the physical location of their equipment</p>
<p>All owners are stored internally using a 1 to 3 character code. This can be letters or digits.</p>
<p>If you own all the equipment in your fleet then there will only be a single owner in the system. If your company was "Fred's Rentals" then a typical owner code would be "FRE". To assist with the entry of fleet items you can set a default owner code in the Utilities/Details screen</p>
<h2>Owner Add</h2>
<p> From the main menu select File/Owner/Add (FAD). The system prompts you for a new owner code. Type your code. If the code is already in use, WinRent will respond "Code already on File". You can either hit Esc to exit from Owner Add or try a new code.</p>
<p>Once you have entered a new code, you will be able to enter some basic owner details. The only details that are mandatory is the name. The others are optional b
ut filling them in is worthwhile as you can use the file as a lookup for leasing details. Hit PgDn (or hit enter several times) to complete or Esc to exit and NOT add the new code or details.</p>
<h2>Owner Edit</h2>
<p> Allows you to change the details on an owner. Enter a valid owner (on that is on file) and edit the details. WinRent will prompt if the owner is not on file</p>
<h2>Owner Delete</h2>
<p>You can only delete an owner when there are no items which use the owner code. The system will check this. You are also prompted to confirm your descision</p>
