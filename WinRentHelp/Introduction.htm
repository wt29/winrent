<h1>Welcome to WinRent</h1>

<p>Winrent is a program designed for the "Whitegoods" rental industry. It allows a user to enter stock/fleet items and then create contracts for the hire of these items. During the creation of the contract hirer details are added to the system.  You can have a virtually unlimited number of hirers attached to a single contract. There is also no practicable limit to the number of items.</p> 

<p>Once contracts are created, payments are made which are recorded in a running audit trail. All contract transactions are recorded. Winrent will generate arrears transactions for contracts which are not paid on time. Optionally, you can also create and send notification letters to hirers in arrears default.<p>

<p> As arrears are paid, the system records these and updates the arrears history. This can be quieried at any time<p>

<p>Each contract maintains a running "paid to" date and a running "ballance bought forward". There is also a continuous audit log of transactions and arrears events (if any).</p> 

<p>The contract is based on a regular hire period. Winrent supports the following payment periods</p>

<ul>
	<li>Daily
	<li>Weekly
	<li>Fortnightly
            <li>Weekly
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Fundamental to the execution of Winrent is the "system date".  This is simply, the date to which all contracts on the system are "up to". The system date is not the computer date (although it often is). The concept of a system date allows the owner to delay "rolling over" the system date until all payments are entered. This prevents contracts registering as "in arrears" due to simple issues such as a delay in processing contract payments. Reasons for this delay could include<p>
<ul>
<li>A weekend
<li>Bank statement delivery delays.
</li>
</ul>

Once all the payments for a particular day have been entered then the System Date can be advanced. If, for example, you have entered 3 days of payments the System Date can be advanced 3 days.
