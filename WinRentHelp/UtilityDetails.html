<h1>Utilities Details</h1>
<p>This screen sets up a number of Winrent System variables. Most of
these variables are system wide, the printer variables are on a "per
workstation" basis. This meanes that the printers need to be set up on
each workstation.</p>
<h4>Address Lines</h4>
Winrent will use these values as output on reports as required<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Default Period of Grace<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p>Winrent will add the value here (if any) to the days a user is in
arrearrs before sending out a letter.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Month for end of year</h4>
<p>Used in asset value calculations. If your end of financial year is
June then insert "06" into this field</p>
<h4>Default Owner</h4>
<p>Provides a default owner value when entering new stock</p>
<h4>Item Start number</h4>
<p>As you add items to &nbsp;WInrent, it adds a sequential number (the
Item ID) to each record. This field allows you to select the starting
value. You can change this at will</p>
<h4>Contract Start Number</h4>
<p>Each contract is identified by a sequential number. This field
allows you set the starting value. In a &nbsp;new WinRent installation,
this will start from 1. Note that the value of "0" (Zero) is reserved
by WinrRent and cannot be used.</p>
<h4>Printers</h4>
<p>Printers are set on a "per workstation" basis, that is you
need&nbsp;bo set the printers on each workstation individual. There are
2 printers supported, a "Report" and a "Letter" printer. The majority
of output is directed to the report printer. If you only use one
printer for both then enter the same details in both fields.</p>
WinRent supports both local and network printers. The most important
thing to remember is the the printer name is case sensiitive and uses
the "Windows Printer Name" for example, if you have a local printer
called "Epson" then you must enter "Epson" in the printer string with
the "E" as a capitalised. Shared printers on other machines are usually
entered as a "UNC" string. e.g you have a printer Epson on a
workstation "Computer1" - the string "\\Computer1\Epson" would be
entered.<br>
<h4>Late Fee Details</h4>
Sets up &nbsp;the abilty to charge late fees and the amounts (fi any)
on the arrears letters<br>
<h4>Editor Program</h4>
Winrent can output most reports to the screen if required. To do this,
it ouputs the report to a text file and then calls an editor program to
display it. If you don't have a preferred editor, enter "notepad.exe"
otherwise enter the full path to your preferred text editor.<br>
