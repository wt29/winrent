<h1>Contract Maintenance</h1>
<p>Contracts are central to the
operation of WinRent. WinRent allocates a unique contract number to
each contract. Contracts tie together "Hirers", Items and contract
specific details such as comments and balances. <br>
Before you can create contracts, you will need to add fleet items
(items) to the system. Access the contract maintenance screen from the
Main Menu using FC. Options in this menu are</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add - Add a new contract to
the system
  </li>
  <li>Change - Change details of
hirers, items and contract detail
  </li>
  <li>Delete - Remove a contract
from the system. You must have no items on hire to delete a contract.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Add</h2>
<p>WinRent will prompt you with
the next sequential contract number. You are free to use this number or
subsitute one of your own. Contract numbers are numeric only. If you
add your own number, Winrent will check to see if the number entered is
unique. You will be prompted to re-enter if it is not.</p>
<p>The first hirer on the contract
is requested. This field is mandatory. If you hit escape or leave the
field blank and no other hirers have been added to the contract,
WinRent will abandon the contract and return you to the Contract
Maintenance MenU</p>
<p>Once a surname is added,
Winrent will present the rest of the hirer details dialog. All of the
fields on this screen are optional. Fill in the details as required and
either hit Enter until the cursor leaves the bottom of the screen or
hit PgDn. <br>
Continue to add hirers to the contract (if any) and finish added hirers
by hitting Enter at a blank surname prompt</p>
<p>Enter the payment period for
the contract. This may be changed later</p>
<p>Winrent will now prompt to
enter the Item code of the first item to be added to the contract. You
may change to "Find by Item Serial No" by hitting <f10>.
<f10> will toggle searching
between Item and Serial numbers</f10></f10></p>
<p>Once you have entered a valid
code, Winrent will add this to the contract and request the rental
amount (for the item) on the period selected for the contract. You can
overwrite this value at any time. Winrent will then prompt for the next
item to be added. You can add an unlimited number of items. Once there
are no more items to add, Hit Enter on a blank item field and Winrent
will proceed to the last step in the addition of a new contract</p>
<p>The following fields are
displayed</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commencement Date - this
field can be in the past or the future. This date is only used for
reference
  </li>
  <li>Paid to Date - this is an
important field. Winrent will record this as literally the "paid to"
date for the contract. The next installment on this contract will be
due on the day after the "Paid to date" </li>
  <li>Period of Grace - this is
the number of days after the "Paid to Date" that the End of Day routine
will wait before it generates an arrears record. For example - If a
contract is Monthly, it is due on the 18th of the month and the Period
of Grace is 3 then the hirer will have up to the 21st of the month
before an arrears notice is generated
  </li>
  <li>Location Area - Is a 3
character code that can be used to group contracts. For example, you
may designate an area as area "1". A Report is available that list all
items for pickup within the same Location Area.
  </li>
  <li>Bond Paid - enter the amount
of Bond paid by the Hirer (if any)
  </li>
  <li>Comments fields. These are
ther "quick" comment field. They can be edited at any time. Note there
is also an "Extended" comment field on each contract (and stock item)
which is often used as a running history. Why are there 2 comment
fields? The quick comments were the original comment fields from when
WinRent was DOS "RENTALS" and ran on a floppy drive
  </li>
  <li>Deposit book Numbers - Some
WinRent users issue a "deposit book" for clients to make deposits. The
Deposit Book Number can be used as a lookup for contracts - especially
during payment entry
  </li>
  <li>Rental Period - Information
field. You may be only renting an item for 6 months
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Hit PgDn to complete and save
the item details. As before Esc will abandon (not save) the data entered</p>
<h2>Change</h2>
<p>Enter the item code to change
details including history fields</p>
<h2>Owner</h2>
<p> This function allows you to
change a range of items from one owner to another. Typically these will
be items coming "off lease". The function requires entering an "old"
owner and a "new" owner. Once entered you can enter a number of item
codes. You will be prompted to confirm each change</p>
<h2>Delete</h2>
<p>Delete old stock items from the
system using this function. Items that are on hire cannot be deleted.
All item history is also deleted.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Used to add repair history to
items</p>
