<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2> Navigating</h2>
<p>Getting around WinRent is simple. It has been designed primarily to keep your hands on the the keyboard. There are 3 ways</p> 
<ul>
<li>Mouse - you can navigate the menus and dialog boxes using the mouse. Generally this is the SLOWEST method
<li>First Letter - all the menu items can be selected by hitting the first letter. This is the FASTEST method
<li>Arrow Keys - use the arrow keys and the Enter key to select menu options
</ul>
<p> Esc (Escape) is used everywhere in Winrent to close menus and dialog boxes. You can also exit Winrent from the main menu by using Esc. Within dialog boxes, Page Down (PgDn) and enter are used to navigate. PgDn will save all details on a dialog and exit. Esc will exit without saving.
<h2>Main Menu</h2>
There are 7 options in the main menu. Briefly they are
<ul>
<li>Enquiry - Enquire on all aspects of the WinRent System. Contracts, Hirers, Items
<li>File - Create/Modify Contracts, Items and Owners
<li>Transactions - Payments are accepted here
<li>Reports - Reports and the arrears letter system
<li>Period - End of day/Month/Year processing
<li>Utilities - Miscellaneous system processes
<li>Exit - exactly that. Exit from WinRent. Esc also works.
</ul>
<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>Once installed there are a few items to be setup before contract entry can begin. Select Utilities/Details to begin. Enter the following details.
<ul>
<li>Company Name - Whatever you want printed on the heading line of you reports
<li>Address Details - Optional - not actually used internally
<li>Default Period of grace - The number of days after the system date that WinRent will begin to log arrears transactions.
<li>Month for End of Year - 2 digit number representing the date for EOY calculations. i.e. 06 for June
<li>Default Owner - when you enter fleet items, you will enter an "owner" code. The Owner is used for grouping items to produce bailment listings. Create a three letter code to represent the owner of the majority of your items. This field just assists in the speed of entry for items
<li>Item/Contract Start numbers - Contracts are allocated a sequential number. Item numbers are optionally sequential. These fields allow you to start these number at an arbitrary value.
<li>Report / Letter printer name. Insert the name of your printer for these classes of reports. Most reports go to the report printer. Note that this is the WINDOWS printer name. The value is CASE Sentive. If your printer is a network printer then use the UNC value i.e. \\Server\PrinterName. Again CASE SENSITIVE. If your report printer is also your letter printer, use the same name twice
<li>Late fee entries - you can optionally change a late fee on  your letters. Set the amount to be charged.
<li>Editor Program - Winrent can optionally display reports to the screen. To do this, it calls an text editor and needs to know which one. Normally setting this to "Notepad.exe" is sufficient.
</ul>
<p>You can use PgDn to exit this page once you have updated a field (or just keep hitting enter). Esc will exit the page without saving any details<p>
