<h1>Statements</h1>
<p>Winrent includes functions to output hirer statements or "Arrears
Letters"</p>
<p>These letters are usually used as as reminders for customers in
arrears however there are also some peripheral functions to send
letters to all or selected customers</p>
<p>The arrears functions can provide up to three levels of letters.
Depending on how you run your business, you may choose to used zero
(no),one, two or three letters.</p>
<p> For example,if you choose to use 3 letters they may have increasing
levels of demand for payment such as</p>
<ul>
  <li>Letter 1 - "Dear Customer, I has come to our attention that
payment on you rental....." </li>
  <li>Letter 2 - "Dear Customer, despite sending you a letter.....A
late fee may be charged...." </li>
  <li>Letter 3 - "Dear Customer, we have now dispatched 2 letters
requesting.... payment must be..." </li>
</ul>
<p>As stated, you can choose to use 0,1,2 or 3 levels of letters.
Winrent will record the date each letter was created as an ongoing
"Arrears" history against contracts. The system will not dispatch a
letter 2 (for example)unless a letter 1 has been sent. This applies to
letter 3 as well. i.e. A letter 3 will not be sent unless letter 2 has
been sent.</p>
<p>Letters are sent based on the period the contract has been overdue
(in arrears) and whether the other letters have been sent. This means
that <i>if you choose to use more that one level of letter (1), you
must make run at the higher level of letters first</i> To explain
further, assume you send Letter 1 7 days after payment due, Letter 2 14
days and Letter 3 21.You go on 3 weeks holiday. When you return your
contracts are at least 14 days in arrears (you haven't posted payments
yet) so you run Letter 1 first, this creates a letter for all users
over 7 days. All good so far, you then run Letter 2, Winrent then
decides that Letter 1 has been sent and then looks at the contracts,
calculates that 14 days has elapsed and then creates Letter 2 <i> for
the same customer</i></p>
<p>If the same sequence is run Letter 3, 2 and then 1, the 2nd (or 3rd)
letter won't be created as the 2nd (or 1st) Letter has not been
created, at this point in time. This may sound convoluted but it is
important to remember.</p>
<p>Note that Winrent can optionally charge a late fee on the dispatch
of the first or second letter. The options to configure this, including
the amount, are in Utilities/Details.</p>
<p>There are 2 options to actually create the letter</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct using the inbuilt text editor</li>
  <li>Creating a "Mail Merge" file and using a commercial word
processor typically Microsoft Word</li>
</ul>
The mail merge system will produce a much more professional letter
however it requires you to understand how to utilise Word mail merging.
<h2>Inbuilt Text Editor</h2>
Once you enter a Statement menu option, you are prompted<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Print Letters? (Answering 'N' will
create a mail merge file)<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Answering
'N' will commence creating a letter using the inbuilt text editor<br>
<br>
Next prompt is "Number of Days Overdue" This value will depend on which
letter you are printing and what your own personally tolerances for
overdue accounts. For example, you may be printing 2 letters with the
first going at 7 days overdue and the second at 14.<br>
<br>
You are now asked for the name of the letter file. This file contains
the text of the letter you are about to send. Most WinRent users call
these (strangely) LETTER1, LETTER2 and LETTER3. You can use any 8
character name for any letter. If the text is already on file, Winrent
will ask "Re-edit Letter File?" Answering "Y" will open the text editor
with the current letter text displayed.<br>
<br>
If the file name is not found, Winrent prompts "File not found"
followed by "Create New Letter File?" Answer "Y" and the text editor
will open. The text editor is particularly primitive however the mail
feature of the system are the "Substitute Variables". These are denoted
by a "%" sign followed by the name of the variable. The name is always
in CAPITALS For example when Winrent sees %AMT in the text, it will
substitutes the current amount owed. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dear Hirer / Hirers,<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your Appliance Rental Agreement currently has an <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
outstanding amount of $%AMT<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This amount was due on %DUE. Please make your payment <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
immediately<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yours faithfully<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MyRent Pty Ltd<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>This letter demonstrates most
of the substitute variables available. To see the full list, Hit F10
inside the world processor. Note the %PAGE at the bottom. This causes
the printer to eject and begin a new page. Without this, the system
will just start the next letter immediately (on the same page) as the
last one.<br>
<br>
Once you have finished editing, you must save the document using
"Ctrl-W" (Control W). Winrent will then ask you if you wish to print a
test page. Winrent will use the first contract on the system
(regardless of whether they are in arrears) as the test document. You
can test this as many times as you need. Once you answer NO to the test
print question, Winrent prompts "Ready to begin printing?" Answer "Y"
to commence. "N" will take you back to the statement menu.<br>
<br>
As printers can be difficult, Winrent waits until all letters (for a
run) have been printed before is asks "OK to update files". If you are
satisfied with the print output then answer "Y' and Winrent will update
the letter field in the arrears file for all contract where a letter
has been produced. e.g. if you are printing Letter 3, all contracts
which have had a letter 3 output will have the current system date
inserted into the Letter 3 field for the arrears details file.<br>
<h2>Mail merge File</h2>
The procedure for outputting a mail merge file is close to that of the
letter printing option.Answering "N" to the "Print Letters" question
will cause Winrent to output a "TAB Delimited" file. The file name will
be LETTER1.CSV, LETTER2.CSV or LETTER3.CSV depending on which letter
you have selected. Again Winrent will ask for the number of days the
contract must be in arrears before the contract is selected for
inclusion.<br>
<br>
The same rules about the precedence of the letters and the "Update
files" section apply as well. <br>
<br>
The mailmerge file has the following fields outputted, one line per
contract.<br>
<br>
Contract Number, First Name, Surname, Address Line 1, Address Line 2,
Suburb (City), Postcode, Amount Due, Date Due, System Date<br>
<br>
Once the file has been built then you will need to use your word
processor to open it and commence the mail merge process. Details of
how to do this are beyond the scope of this manual.
